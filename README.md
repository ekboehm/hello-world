# hello-world
I was told to do this by the guide.

It seems I am excecptionally good at following orders, which is good I guess. Have you ever played Stanley's Parable? It's quite like that, the feeling of being rewarded for doing exactly as being told and then passing it off as some kind of weird freedom and achievement. Great indeed.

The power, of course, is in the replication. Which will come later, and feature no orders. How boring though.
